# MRT_analysis## About the projectVisualize the ridership statistics per station using open data from [metro Taipei](https://www.metro.taipei/cp.aspx?n=FF31501BEBDD0136&fbclid=IwAR20Df9ASOjw9qJYmHgFRXFOHQOP5xV2h1DA3MFmREj641ksJBwFmByT8js) and develop a naive algorithm to predict the upcoming ridership counts.All the data from 2017-2019 will be categorized into four groups, representing four main transit stations, Taipei Main Station, Banciao Station, Songshan Station, and Nangang Station.## Algorithm ### Variable * Temperature * Rainfall### Special cases* Events or festivals* Winter/Summer vacation## First step1. Remove useless data in the test directory (focusing on 08-09AM and 06-07PM during Sep-Nov in 2017-2019).2. Crawl web data from [Central Weather Bureau](https://e-service.cwb.gov.tw/HistoryDataQuery/index.jsp).## Second step TBD## Midterm presentation* Visualize the ridership counts from four main transit stations.* Try to predict ridership counts in Nov (or Oct) using weather variables.## Final presentation * Improve accuracy of the ridership prediction.* Combine real time traffic info from [Department of Transportation](https://www.bote.gov.taipei/Content_List.aspx?n=EAC17E905EB08680).## Useful link [Github 101](http://gogojimmy.net/2012/01/17/how-to-use-git-1-git-basic/)[How to cowork](https://medium.com/開發隨筆/git-共同協作開發-adac8ed2e949)## Contact Pu-Sheng Chen sam7k9621@gmail.com
